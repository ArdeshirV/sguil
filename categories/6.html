<h2>Category VI: Reconnaissance</h2>  
<p>A category VI event occurs when an adversary attempts to learn about a target system or network, with the presumed intent to later compromise that system or network.  Reconnaissance events include port scans, enumeration of NetBIOS shares on Windows systems, inquiries concerning the version of applications on servers, unauthorized zone transfers, and similar activity.  Category VI activity also includes limited attempts to guess user names and passwords.  Sustained, intense guessing of user names and passwords would be considered category III events if unsuccessful.</p>
