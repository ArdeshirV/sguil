Quick guide on how to use the patch_barnyard.sh script.

This script assumes that you have installed the sguil tarball/cvs tree
(the whole tree) on the machine you build barnyard on. You run it
as:

./patch_barnyard.sh /path/where/you/have/the/barnyard/source/tree \
/path/where/you/have/sguil/source/tree

Example:

./patch_barnyard.sh /usr/local/src/barnyard /usr/local/src/sguil

If you only copied the 'barnyard_mods' directory to your
sensor you have to apply the patch by hand. 

1) Copy op_sguil.* to barnyard/src/output-plugins/
2) Change directory to the root directory of barnyard source
3) Execute 'patch -p0 < /path/to/barnyard.patch'
