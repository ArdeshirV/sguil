<h2>Category V: Poor Security Practice or Policy Violation</h2>  A category V event occurs when the MNSS operation detects a condition which exposes the client to unnecessary risk of exploitation.  For example, should a MNSS analyst discover that a client domain name system server allows zone transfers to all Internet users, she will report the incident as a category V event.  (Zone transfers provide complete information on the host names and IP addresses of client machines.)  Violations of a client's security policy also constitutes a category V incident.  Should a client forbid the use of peer-to-peer file sharing applications, detections of  Napster or Gnutella traffic will be reported as category V events.</p>
