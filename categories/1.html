<h2>Category I: Root/Administrator Account Compromise</h2>
<p>A category I event occurs when an unauthorized party gains 'root' or 'administrator' control of a client computer.  Unauthorized parties include human adversaries and automated malicious code, such as a worm.  On UNIX-like systems, the 'root' account is the 'super-user,' generally capable of taking any action desired by the unauthorized party.  (Note that so-called 'Trusted' operating systems (OS), like Sun Microsystem's 'Trusted Solaris,' divide the powers of the root account among various operators.  Compromise of any one of these accounts on a 'Trusted' OS constitutes a category I incident.)  On Windows systems, the 'administrator' has near complete control of the computer, although some powers remain with the 'SYSTEM' account used internally by the OS itself.  (Compromise of the SYSTEM account is considered a category I event as well.)  Category I incidents are potentially the most damaging type of event.</p>
