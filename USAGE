Connecting to the Server:
Once the server (sguild) is running and the client (sguil.tk) can
connect, you can manage events on a near realtime basis. Events
populate the panes based on their priority (this is configurable).
Multiple clients can connect to a server at a time. This client/server
configuration also allows analyst to connect remotely more easily.
For example, if an analyst has remote ssh access to the server network,
he/she can tunnel the client/server comms over ssh.
(i.e. `ssh mysystem.server.net -L 7734:sguildsystem:7734` now fire up
sguil.tk and point it toward localhost.)
 


Managing Events:
Once an event has been reviewed, its status can be updated and the
event deleted from the client. To expire an event and set its status
to 1, select the event to expire->right click in status (ST) column
->Select Expire from the menu. Events validated as malicious can
also be placed into one of seven incident categories (see
File->Display Incident Categories for a description) by selecting
Update Event Status->Category from the menu. When an event is expired
or placed into Incident Category, it is removed from all connected
clients. Hot keys can also be used:

<F1>-<F7>: Place the event into Category I - VII
<F8>:  Expire the event.


Querying the DB:
Searches can be initiated using different "templates". For a blank
template, use File->Query. Once selected, a window allowing you to
edit the query will pop up. Only the WHERE statement can be edited.
IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE THE JOIN (event.sid=sensor.sid), it is 
required on ALL queries. Other templates are available by selecting
an event and right clicking on the src/dst ip columns.

Correlated Events:
Events that have the same src IP and signature/message are correlated
under the same event in the appropriate RT pane. Each time an event
is "correlated" the CNT field is incrimented by one. To view all
the correlated events, select the event->right click on the CNT
column->View Correlated Events. The shortcut for this info is to
middle click on the CNT column of a selected event.

Generating Transcripts, loading data into Ethereal:
Make sure Ethereal is installed on the client system. Select an alert,
right click on the sid.cid column. Select Transcript or Ethereal. 
Middle clicking on the sid.cid column of a highlighted event will
also request a transcript.


Other:
The up/down arrows can be used to select previous/next event in the
pane. <Esc> will unselect all options (dns, whois, packet date, etc)
at once.
