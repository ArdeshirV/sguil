<h2>Category III: Attempted Account Compromise</h2>
<p>A category III event occurs when an unauthorized party attempts to gain root/administrator or user level access on a client computer.  The exploitation attempt fails for one of several reasons.  First, the target may be properly patched to reject the attack.  Second, the attacker may find a vulnerable machine, but he may not be sufficiently skilled to execute the attack.  Third, the target may be vulnerable to the attack, but its configuration prevents compromise.  (For example, an IIS web server may be vulnerable to an exploit employed by a worm, but the default locations of critical files have been altered.)</p>
