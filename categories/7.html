<h2>Category VII: Virus Activity</h2>
<p>A category VII event occurs when a client system becomes infected by a virus.  Note the emphasis here is on the term virus, as opposed to a worm.  Viruses depend on one or both of the following conditions: (1) human interaction is required to propagate the virus; (2) the virus must attach itself to a 'host' file, such as an email message, Word document, or web page.  Worms, on the other hand, are capable of propagating themselves without human interaction or host files.  A compromise caused by a worm would qualify as a category I or II event.</p>
