<h2>Category II: User Account Compromise</h2>
<p>A category II event occurs when an unauthorized party gains control of any non-root or non-administrator account on a client computer.  User accounts include those held by people as well as applications.  For example, services may be configured to run or interact with various non-root or non-administrator accounts, such as 'apache' for the Apache web server or 'IUSR_machinename' for Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS).  Category II incidents are treated as though they will quickly escalate to Category I events.  Skilled attackers will elevate their privileges once they acquire user status on the victim machine.</p>
