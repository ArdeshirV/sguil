CVS-HEAD

  sguil.tk
    * Fixed fcopy bug for Ethereal requests (thanks
      Tim Slighter).

    * Added better Ethereal config options in (sguil.conf)

    * Added/Modified Dshield lookup (http://www.dshield.org)
      to src and dst ip drop down menus. (requested by mboman
      added by geek2)
 
    * Modified client authentication. See sguild comments for
      more information. (NOTE: sguil.tk now REQUIRES tcllib)

    * Added initial support for standard queries.

  sguild
    * Alpha support for emailing events. 

    * Proc SendSensorList now makes sure sensor.active=y.

    * Added a salt to passwd hash in sguild.users. The
      authentication has been modified so the client never
      sends the passwd. Instead, the salt and noonce are
      sent to the client and returned hash is compared by
      the server. (NOTE: Old sguild.users files will NOT
      work.)

    * Added initial support for standard queries. 

  sguild.conf
    * Vars for emailing selected events.

  log_packets.sh
    * Removed some legacy hostname stuff.

sguil-0.2.5 (15 Jul 2003)

  * Multiple undocumented bugfixes. I recommend updating
    all sguil components (no need to repatch snort and
    barnyard) to include sguild, xscriptd, sensor_agent.tcl,
    log_packets.sh, and sguil.tk.

sguil-0.2.4 (11 Jul 2003)
  sguil.tk
    * Added lib/whois.tcl, a simple replacement for those
      third party whois scripts.

    * Client remains up on disconnect from sguild. Attempts
      to reconnect after 10 seconds.

    * Decode ICMP redirect

    * Added option to change the max number of rows returned
      for portscan event data. Set the default in sguil.conf.

    * Added 'User Messages' box for analyst to communicate
      via text messages.

  sguild
    * Added -D (daemonize) and -P <pidFile> switches.

    * Changed sensorCmd to use ctoken to avoid crashes
      when special chars are in the message

    * Added OpenSSL for client <> server comms.

    * Does version checking with clients

    * Checks for compatable DB schema

    * Added sha1 support for hashed passwds plus
      -adduser and -deluser functions. Authentication
      should now be considered fairly secure when used
      in conjunction with OpenSSL or ssh tunneling.

  xscriptd
    * Added -D (daemonize) and -P <pidFile> switches.

    * Using a regexp instead of lindex to test for spp_portscan
      event, avoids error on special chars

    * Added OpenSSL for client <> server comms.

    * Added version checking for connecting clients.

    * Added SimpleQueryCommand for OOB queries

    * MulitiSelect functionality added by Steve Halligan (geek2)
      shalligan@333tech.com.

      Windows.

Version 0.1 BETA 4
  *NOTE: This version requires a slight modification to
          the sguil.conf [addition of the CATEGORY_COLOR(ES)]

  sguild
    * Fixed GetPSData bug (didn't close mysql socket).
   
    * Now handles escalated events (very beta right
      now).

  sguil.tk
    * Added an Escalation tab. Use F9 or right click->
      Update Event Status->Escalate to move alerts into
      this tab. Allows analyst to easily "bookmark"
      alerts for later review while keeping the RT
      screen clear.

 

Version 0.1 BETA 3

  sguil.tk
    * Ctrl-left/right arrow selects previous/next tab

    * Added a "force new" option for generating xscripts. This
      forces xscriptd to ignore any locally archived sessions
      and try to get a new one. Useful where a xscript was
      generated mid session and the analyst wants to see if
      more acty has occurred.

    * The transcript window now shows debug messages (per geek2).

  xscriptd
    * Added a "force new" option for generating xscripts. See
      above for more info.

    * Sends debug message for the transcript window.

      click on selected event in the Event Type
     column).

    * Query templates pop up under mouse position.

    * Unselected tabs are now darker. Oooo pretty.

  sguild
    * Fixed portscan passwd bug.

Version 0.1 BETA 1
  LICENSE
    * When sguil is finally released, it will
      be done so over the QPL. BY is licensed under
      the QPL, therefore op_sguil must be released
      under that license and it's easier just to use
      one license for everything.

    * spp_portscan mod introduced as well as a loader
      for the DB and an interface to the data within
      sguil.tk.

  xscriptd

  sguild
    * Syslog is no longer used for sending and sguild now
      opens port 7736 for and op_sguil is connects/sends
      RT events directly to sguild.

  op_sguil.c
    * SguilSendEvents() was added and all syslog references
      were removed. See comments in op_sguil.c for more info.

      at http://www.speechio.org.
    * Fixed xscript cmd interpretation bug.
    * Added a text box to the query tabs to display the
      query statement. Modifying the query and pressing
      <Enter> will run a new query.
    * Query's can now be sorted by double clicking on 
      the list label (ie Src IP, Dst IP, etc).

  xscriptd

  Added a USAGE file.

  sguild:
    * Added DBPASS for mysql passwd.
